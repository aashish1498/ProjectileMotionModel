----SHELLSHOCK CALCULATOR----
Thank you for downloading my Shellshock calculator!

----INSTALLATION----
To install the program, double click the 'ShellshockCalcInstaller' Windows Installation Package and follow the installer instructions.

To start the program, run the exe on your desktop, or in the start menu 'TheWaffleTimeCat' folder.

----CALIBRATION----
Whenever you start the program, you need to calibrate it to your screen dimensions. To do this, move the green square on the left side of the Game window, and the red square on the right, and click 'Calibrate'.

----HOW TO USE IT----
The green square is your tank, and red square is the enemy tank (or where you want your shot to land). Move these to your desired positions, and update the wind and angle in the text boxes at the top of the screen. The 'Power' text box at the bottom of the screen will automatically update and tell you what power you need to shoot at. This power does NOT take into account portals.

If there are portals that you want to use/take into account, move the blue and orange circles to where the blue and orange portals are respectively. Then click 'Think with portals' to get the updated power below the button. This will also provide a tracer which tells you how your arc will look. 

Note that it might not be possible to find a power that will hit the enemy. In this case, the Power will be NaN, and you'll need to try a different angle.

You can clear the tracer by clicking 'Clear screen'

----MORE INFORMATION----
Wind is positive in the direction of your shot, and negative if it opposes your shot.

Some weapons e.g. the BFG or Seagull are slower, and more suspectible to wind. In this case, use twice the in-game wind in the calculator (e.g. if the wind in the game is -24, use -48 in the calculator).
